## Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Daily challenges table
CREATE TABLE daily_challenges (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  game_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  challenge_date DATE NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  challenge_config JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User streaks tracking
CREATE TABLE user_streaks (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users PRIMARY KEY,
  current_streak INT DEFAULT 0,
  longest_streak INT DEFAULT 0,
  last_play_date DATE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Game recommendations
CREATE TABLE game_recommendations (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  game_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  score FLOAT NOT NULL,
  reason VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, game_id)
);

-- Enhanced level progress
ALTER TABLE user_level_progress 
ADD COLUMN total_play_time INT DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN perfect_completions INT DEFAULT 0;
```

## Risk Management

- Challenge system for head-to-head play
- Activity feed showing friend achievements
- Social sharing improvements

### User Experience
- Onboarding tutorial for new users
- Game recommendation quiz
- Customizable homepage layout
- Quick-play mode for instant gaming
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Enhancements
```typescript
// New feature modules
/features
  /tournaments
  /leaderboards
  /achievements
  /social
  /analytics
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Tournament tables
tournaments, tournament_entries, tournament_results

-- Achievement tables  
achievements, user_achievements, achievement_progress

-- Social tables
friendships, challenges, activity_feed

-- Analytics tables
game_analytics, user_sessions, performance_metrics
```

### API Structure
```
/api/v1
  /tournaments
  /leaderboards
  /achievements
  /social
  /analytics
  /games/{gameId}/multiplayer
```

## Performance Targets

### Web Vitals
- FCP: < 1.5s
- LCP: < 2.5s
- CLS: < 0.1
- FID: < 100ms

### Bundle Size
- Main bundle: < 100KB (currently 87.5KB)
- Per-game lazy loading: < 20KB each
- Code splitting by category

### Scalability
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- Real-time updates < 100ms latency
- Database query optimization
- CDN asset delivery

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database scaling**: Implement connection pooling, query optimization
- **Real-time performance**: Use Supabase edge functions for critical paths
- **Bundle size growth**: Aggressive code splitting, tree shaking
- **Browser compatibility**: Progressive enhancement approach

### Operational Risks
- **Monitoring gaps**: Comprehensive Sentry integration
- **Deployment failures**: Blue-green deployment strategy
- **Data loss**: Regular automated backups
- **Security**: Regular dependency updates, security audits

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily Active Users (DAU) > 1,000
- Average session duration > 15 minutes
- Games per session > 3
- Return rate > 40%

### Technical Metrics
- Uptime > 99.9%
- Page load time < 2s
- Error rate < 0.1%
- API response time < 200ms

## Timeline

**Day 1-2**: Production deployment setup
**Day 3-4**: Global features (leaderboards, tournaments, achievements)
**Day 5-6**: New game implementation (20 games)
**Day 7**: Social features and final optimization

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create deployment branch
2. Configure Vercel production environment
3. Set up Supabase production instance
4. Implement monitoring infrastructure
5. Begin global leaderboard development

## Dependencies

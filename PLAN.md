   - Go Fish: Card matching, AI strategy
   - War: Card comparison, war resolution
   - Crazy Eights: Suit/number matching, wild cards
   - Hearts: Trick-taking, point calculation
   - Spades: Bidding system, partnership scoring

2. **Integration Tasks**
   - Connect QuickPlay modal to actual game launchers
   - Wire up real-time leaderboards via Supabase
   - Implement game rating persistence
   - Enable featured games rotation
   - Ensure all 60 games properly categorized

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to Vercel with environment variables
   - Configure Supabase production instance
   - Set up monitoring (Sentry)
   - Implement CDN caching

### Game State Management
```typescript
interface GameState {
  board?: any[][]       // For board games
  deck?: Card[]         // For card games
  players: Player[]
  currentTurn: number
  score: Record<string, number>
  gameOver: boolean
  winner?: string
  aiDifficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- AI game sessions
ALTER TABLE game_sessions 
ADD COLUMN game_state JSONB,
ADD COLUMN ai_difficulty VARCHAR(20),
ADD COLUMN move_history JSONB[];

-- Game replays
CREATE TABLE game_replays (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  game_id VARCHAR(50),
  player_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  replay_data JSONB,
  final_score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Update featured games for new additions
INSERT INTO featured_games (game_id, category_id, position)
VALUES 
  ('chess', (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE slug = 'strategy'), 1),
  ('checkers', (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE slug = 'strategy'), 2),
  ('hearts', (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE slug = 'card'), 1);
```

## Technical Decisions
- Use chess.js library for chess rules
- Implement card games with shared deck utilities
- Use Web Workers for AI calculations
- Lazy load game components
- IndexedDB for game state persistence

## Success Metrics

- **Bundle**: < 100KB maintained
- **Performance**: < 2s page load
- **Quality**: All games fully playable
- **Integration**: 100% features connected
- **Production**: Successfully deployed

## Risk Mitigation
- **Bundle Size**: Aggressive code splitting per game
- **AI Performance**: Web Workers for heavy calculations
- **Complex Rules**: Use established libraries where available
- **Testing**: Automated test suites for game logic
- **Deployment**: Staged rollout with feature flags

## Dependencies
- chess.js for chess rules (npm install)
- Existing UI components from previous cycles
- Supabase client configured

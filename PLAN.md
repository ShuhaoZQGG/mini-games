## Technical Architecture

### Deployment Infrastructure
```yaml
Production Stack:
  Frontend:
    - Platform: Vercel Edge Network
    - Regions: Global with auto-scaling
    - Cache: Aggressive CDN caching
    - SSL: Auto-provisioned certificates
  
  Backend:
    - Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
    - Auth: Supabase Auth with social providers
    - Realtime: Supabase Channels
    - Storage: Supabase Storage for assets
  
  Monitoring:
    - Errors: Sentry with source maps
    - Analytics: Google Analytics 4
    - Performance: Web Vitals tracking

```

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Code splitting strategy
const categoryRoutes = {
  puzzle: () => import('./categories/puzzle'),
  action: () => import('./categories/action'),
  strategy: () => import('./categories/strategy'),
  multiplayer: () => import('./categories/multiplayer'),
  // ... other categories
}

// Bundle targets
const performanceTargets = {
  initialBundle: '< 50KB',
  lazyChunks: '< 30KB each',
  firstContentfulPaint: '< 1s',
  timeToInteractive: '< 2s',
  cumulativeLayoutShift: '< 0.1'
}
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Category recommendations
CREATE TABLE category_recommendations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id),
  score FLOAT NOT NULL,
  factors JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Category mastery tracking
CREATE TABLE category_mastery (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id),
  games_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  games_total INTEGER NOT NULL,
  mastery_level INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Cross-category tournaments
CREATE TABLE cross_tournaments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  categories UUID[] NOT NULL,
  start_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  prize_pool JSONB,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'scheduled'
);
```

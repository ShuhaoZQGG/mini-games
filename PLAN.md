## Architecture & Design

### Tournament Enhancements
```typescript
interface TournamentHistory {
  tournament_id: string
  user_id: string
  placement: number
  matches_played: number
  matches_won: number
  total_score: number
  completed_at: Date
}

interface SpectatorMode {
  game_id: string
  viewers: string[]
  live_stream: GameState
  chat_enabled: boolean
}
```

### New Games Architecture
1. **Solitaire**: Card game with drag-and-drop
2. **Simon Says**: Memory sequence game
3. **Whack-a-Mole**: Reaction-based clicking

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (existing)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with fallback
- **Analytics**: Plausible (configured)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Tournament Infrastructure (40%)
1. Tournament history tracking
2. Statistics dashboard
3. Friend-only leaderboards
4. Private tournament creation
5. Tournament search/filter

### Phase 2: Spectator Mode (30%)
1. Real-time game state broadcasting
2. Viewer count tracking
3. Spectator UI overlay
4. Live commentary system
5. Replay functionality

### Phase 3: New Games (30%)
1. **Solitaire (Klondike)**
   - Card deck management
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Auto-complete detection
   - Undo/hint system

2. **Simon Says**
   - Sequence generation
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Sound/visual feedback
   - High score tracking

3. **Whack-a-Mole**
   - Random mole spawning
   - Difficulty scaling
   - Power-ups system
   - Combo multipliers

## Technical Specifications

### Database Updates
```sql
-- Tournament history table
CREATE TABLE tournament_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  tournament_id UUID REFERENCES tournaments(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  placement INTEGER NOT NULL,
  matches_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  matches_won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Spectator tracking
CREATE TABLE spectators (
  game_session_id UUID,
  viewer_id UUID,
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (game_session_id, viewer_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tournaments/history` - User tournament history
- `GET /api/tournaments/:id/spectate` - Join as spectator
- `POST /api/tournaments/private` - Create private tournament
- `GET /api/leaderboards/friends` - Friend-only leaderboards

### Performance Targets
- Page load: <2s
- Game start: <1s
- Real-time latency: <100ms
- Bundle size: <100KB

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **WebSocket scaling** - Mitigated by connection pooling
2. **State synchronization** - Use optimistic updates
3. **Browser compatibility** - Progressive enhancement

### Business Risks
1. **User adoption** - A/B test features
2. **Server costs** - Implement caching
3. **Content moderation** - Add reporting system

## Success Metrics

### KPIs
- Tournament participation: >20% of users
- Spectator engagement: >5 min average
- New game retention: >30% replay rate
- Friend connections: >3 per user

### Technical Metrics
- Core Web Vitals: All green
- Error rate: <0.1%
- API latency: p95 <200ms
- Uptime: 99.9%

## Timeline

### Week 1
- Tournament history implementation
- Statistics dashboard
- Friend-only leaderboards

### Week 2
- Spectator mode infrastructure
- Real-time broadcasting
- Viewer UI components

### Week 3
- Solitaire game implementation
- Simon Says game
- Whack-a-Mole game

### Week 4
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Supabase (existing)
- Plausible Analytics (existing)
- Vercel (existing)

### Libraries
- No new dependencies required
- Use existing React DnD for Solitaire

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Tournament data visibility controls
2. **Rate Limiting**: Spectator connection limits
3. **Input Validation**: Game state verification
4. **Authentication**: Private tournament access control

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Tournament service functions
- Game logic for new games
- Spectator state management

### Integration Tests
- Tournament flow end-to-end
- Spectator mode synchronization
- Friend leaderboard filtering

### Performance Tests
- Load testing for spectators
- Game state broadcast latency
- Database query optimization

## Deployment Plan

1. Feature flags for gradual rollout
2. A/B test tournament features
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Staged deployment (dev → staging → prod)

## Post-Launch

### Monitoring
- Tournament participation rates
- Game engagement metrics
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance dashboards

### Optimization
- CDN for game assets
- Database query caching
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Bundle size optimization

## Next Cycle Recommendations

1. **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android
2. **Monetization**: Premium features
3. **AI Opponents**: Smart game AI
4. **Global Tournaments**: Scheduled events
5. **Achievements 2.0**: Seasonal challenges

## Conclusion

Cycle 12 delivers critical tournament features and content expansion that will drive user engagement and platform growth. The implementation is technically feasible within the timeline and aligns with the project's SEO and traffic acquisition goals.

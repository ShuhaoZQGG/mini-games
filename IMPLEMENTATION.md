#### Objective
Fix critical build errors identified in Cycle 16 review to enable production deployment.

#### Critical Issues Fixed

   - Fixed unescaped apostrophes by using HTML entities (&apos;)
   - Resolved React/JSX text content warnings

2. **Script Permissions** (scripts/setup-production.sh)
   - Made script executable with chmod +x
   - Ensures deployment automation works correctly

3. **TypeScript Errors** (lib/services/spectator.ts)

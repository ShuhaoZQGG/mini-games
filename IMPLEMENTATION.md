3. **Tetris with Levels**
   - 5 difficulty levels with progressive speed (1000ms to 150ms)
   - Speed increase multipliers per level
   - Target lines increase with difficulty
   - Score multipliers based on lines cleared

**Previously Completed (Cycles 1-3):**
4. **CPS Test** - 5 levels with increasing click targets
5. **Snake** - 5 levels with speed progression
6. **Memory Match** - 5 levels with grid expansion
7. **2048** - 5 levels with grid variations

#### Project Progress
- **Level System Coverage**: 10/30 games (33%) - 2.5x improvement
- **Games with Levels**: 10 games fully integrated
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful (87.2KB bundle)
- **PR Created**: #25 targeting main branch

#### Technical Implementation
- Consistent use of GameWithLevels wrapper
- Star rating algorithms tailored per game
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- Maintained TypeScript type safety
- Fixed ShareCard prop compatibility

#### Next Priority Tasks
1. Continue level system rollout (20 remaining games)
2. Begin Chess multiplayer implementation
3. Setup Vercel production configuration
4. Implement daily challenges system

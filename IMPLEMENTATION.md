## Page Routes Created

1. `/app/games/solitaire/page.tsx` - Solitaire game page with SEO metadata
2. `/app/games/simon-says/page.tsx` - Simon Says page with proper meta tags
3. `/app/games/whack-a-mole/page.tsx` - Whack-a-Mole page with descriptions

## Architecture Patterns Followed

### TDD Approach
- Wrote comprehensive tests first for each game logic module
- Implemented minimal code to pass tests
- Refactored for code quality while maintaining test coverage
- Added integration tests for UI components

### Consistent Game Structure
Each game follows the established pattern:
- Separate logic class in `/lib/games/`
- React component in `/components/games/`
- Page route in `/app/games/[game-name]/`
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for components

### Shared Features
All games integrate with existing services:
- Score persistence via `scoreService`
- Share functionality with `ShareCard` component
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- Mobile touch event handling

## Mobile & Responsive Design

### Touch Support
- Solitaire: Touch-to-drag cards, double-tap for auto-move
- Simon Says: Touch color buttons, swipe gestures
- Whack-a-Mole: Touch holes, multi-touch for power-ups

### Responsive Layouts
- Flexible grid systems that adapt to screen size
- Appropriately sized touch targets for mobile
- Optimized font sizes and spacing
- Landscape and portrait orientation support

## Score Integration
All games save scores with metadata:
- Solitaire: moves, time, cards in foundations
- Simon Says: level reached, speed setting
- Whack-a-Mole: accuracy, combos, moles whacked

## TypeScript Types
Complete type definitions for:
- Game states and enums
- Card structures (Solitaire)
- Color and speed options (Simon Says)
- Hole contents and power-ups (Whack-a-Mole)

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all game logic methods
- State transition testing
- Score calculation verification
- Power-up and special feature testing
- UI component rendering tests
- User interaction simulation

## Performance Optimizations
- Efficient timer management with cleanup
- Memoized callbacks to prevent re-renders
- Optimized animation with CSS transitions
- Lazy state updates for smooth gameplay

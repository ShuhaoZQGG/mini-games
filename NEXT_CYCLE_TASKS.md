# Next Cycle Tasks

## Immediate Priority - Merge Conflict Resolution

### Critical Action Required
PR #18 has been APPROVED but cannot be merged due to conflicts with the main branch.

**Next Developer Must:**
1. Checkout PR #18 branch
2. Resolve merge conflicts with main branch  
3. Ensure build still passes after conflict resolution
4. Merge PR to main
5. Deploy to production

### Conflict Resolution Steps
```bash
gh pr checkout 18
git fetch origin cycle-1-create-that-20250905-171420
git merge origin/cycle-1-create-that-20250905-171420
# Resolve conflicts keeping Cycle 17 changes (they include all 18 games)
npm run build  # Verify build still works
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with main"
git push
gh pr merge 18 --squash --delete-branch
```

## Production Deployment Tasks

Once PR #18 is merged:

### 1. Supabase Setup
- Create production Supabase project
- Apply database migrations (scripts/apply-migrations.sql)
- Configure RLS policies
- Set up authentication providers

### 2. Vercel Deployment
- Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
- Configure environment variables from .env.production.template
- Deploy main branch
- Verify deployment succeeds

### 3. Post-Deployment
- Configure custom domain (if available)
- Set up monitoring (Vercel Analytics)
- Test all 18 games in production
- Verify authentication flow
- Test real-time features

## Future Enhancement Tasks (Post-Launch)

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement image optimization for game assets
- Add lazy loading for game components
- Optimize bundle splitting
- Implement Redis caching for leaderboards

### Feature Enhancements
- Add more games to reach 25-30+ total
- Implement achievement badges
- Add daily challenges
- Create seasonal tournaments
- Build mobile app wrapper (React Native)
- Add reward/monetization system

### SEO & Marketing
- Submit sitemap to search engines
- Implement structured data for games
- Add social media meta tags
- Create landing pages for each game category

### Technical Debt
- Improve test coverage (currently failing due to env vars)
- Add E2E tests with Playwright
- Implement error boundary components
- Add comprehensive logging
- Fix remaining ESLint warnings (non-critical)
- Update documentation

## Project Status Summary
- **Games**: 18/15+ implemented (120% MVP complete)
- **Features**: All platform features complete
- **Build**: ✅ Successful (Cycle 17 fixed all errors)
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Approved
- **Deployment**: Ready pending merge conflict resolution
- **Production**: Ready to launch after deployment

## Notes
The platform is feature-complete and production-ready. The only blocker is the merge conflict between PR #18 and the main branch. Once resolved and deployed, the platform can be launched to users immediately.

All critical build errors from Cycle 16 have been fixed in Cycle 17:
- ✅ ESLint errors fixed
- ✅ Script permissions corrected
- ✅ TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Build completes successfully

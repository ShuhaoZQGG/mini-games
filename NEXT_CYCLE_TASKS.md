- [ ] Create shareable score cards
- [ ] Add "Beat my score" functionality

## Priority 4: Platform Enhancements

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX
- [ ] Create game category filters
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add game recommendations

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Add PWA manifest and service worker
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for games
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### SEO Enhancements
- [ ] Create individual game sitemaps
- [ ] Add structured data for games
- [ ] Implement Open Graph images
- [ ] Create game-specific meta descriptions
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation

## Technical Debt
Issues to address from Cycle 1:

### Configuration Fixes
- [ ] Update ESLint configuration for Next.js 14
- [ ] Fix Tailwind content configuration warning
- [ ] Configure Supabase environment variables
- [ ] Set up proper error boundaries

### Code Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Add error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript strict mode

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create game development guide
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Deployment & Operations

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure staging environment
- [ ] Implement feature flags
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add analytics (privacy-focused)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance budgets
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Monitor database performance

## Success Metrics to Track
- Page load time (<3s target)
- Game engagement rates
- User retention (day 1, day 7, day 30)
- Organic search traffic growth
- Social shares per game
- Average session duration (>5min target)

## Recommended Cycle 2 Focus
1. **Must Have**: Implement 3-5 more games (Snake, 2048, Sudoku priority)
2. **Should Have**: Set up database schema and basic leaderboards
3. **Nice to Have**: Dark mode toggle and social sharing
4. **Can Wait**: Full authentication system and user profiles

## Notes for Next Developer
- Current implementation uses session-only storage for scores
- Supabase client is configured but not connected to a project
- All games follow the BaseGame abstract class pattern
- Mobile responsiveness is functional but could use tablet optimization
- Consider using Canvas API for Snake and Phaser for more complex games

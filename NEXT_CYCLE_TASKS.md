## Notes for Next Developer

### Critical Path
1. First complete the 2 missing games (Pinball, Nonogram)
2. Fix all navigation and integration issues
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Then PR can be approved and merged

### Known Issues
- 14 test suites currently failing (pre-existing)
- ESLint configuration needs update
- Some games missing from database migration
- PR #35 and #37 need attention

### Resources
- All game implementations follow similar patterns
- Use existing games as templates
- Category system is already built, just needs integration
- Database schema supports all planned features

### Success Criteria
- All 4 new games implemented and playable
- Navigation includes all games
- Tests passing (or at least not worse)
- Clean build with no errors
- PR can be merged to main

## Notes for Next Developer
- Supabase credentials need to be configured for full backend functionality
- The mock/fallback system works well for development
- All 15 games are complete and working
- Real-time and profile features are ready but using mock data
- Focus on social features to drive user engagement
- PWA implementation will significantly improve mobile experience
- Consider implementing the most requested games from user feedback first

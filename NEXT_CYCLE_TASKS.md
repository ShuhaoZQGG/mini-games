# Next Cycle Tasks

## MVP Complete! ðŸŽ‰
All 15 core games have been successfully implemented. Focus now shifts to platform enhancement and user engagement features.

## Priority 1: Database Integration & Persistence
Connect the existing infrastructure to live Supabase backend:

### Immediate Database Tasks
- [ ] Configure Supabase environment variables in .env.local
- [ ] Run existing database migrations (already defined in codebase)
- [ ] Connect scoreService to actual Supabase backend
- [ ] Test score persistence across all 15 games
- [ ] Implement real-time leaderboard updates
- [ ] Add data validation and anti-cheat measures

## Priority 2: Database & Persistence
Implement Supabase backend functionality:

### Database Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase migrations for core tables:
  - `games` table (game metadata)
  - `scores` table (score history)
  - `leaderboards` table (cached rankings)
  - `profiles` table (user profiles)
  - `achievements` table (unlockables)
- [ ] Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Create database indexes for performance
- [ ] Implement connection pooling

### Score System
- [ ] Implement score submission API
- [ ] Add score validation and anti-cheat measures
- [ ] Create leaderboard calculation logic
- [ ] Add daily/weekly/all-time leaderboard views

## Priority 3: User Features
Add engagement and retention features:

### Authentication (Optional)
- [ ] Implement Supabase Auth with social providers
- [ ] Create sign-up/sign-in modals
- [ ] Add "Continue as Guest" option
- [ ] Implement soft registration prompts after 3 games

### User Profiles
- [ ] Create profile page with stats
- [ ] Add avatar upload functionality
- [ ] Implement username selection
- [ ] Display game history and achievements

### Social Features
- [ ] Add social sharing buttons for scores
- [ ] Implement challenge links
- [ ] Create shareable score cards
- [ ] Add "Beat my score" functionality

## Priority 4: Platform Enhancements

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX
- [ ] Create game category filters
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Add game recommendations

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Add PWA manifest and service worker
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for games
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### SEO Enhancements
- [ ] Create individual game sitemaps
- [ ] Add structured data for games
- [ ] Implement Open Graph images
- [ ] Create game-specific meta descriptions
- [ ] Add breadcrumb navigation

## Technical Debt
Issues to address from Cycle 1:

### Configuration Fixes
- [ ] Update ESLint configuration for Next.js 14
- [ ] Fix Tailwind content configuration warning
- [ ] Configure Supabase environment variables
- [ ] Set up proper error boundaries

### Code Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for game logic
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Add error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript strict mode

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Add inline code documentation
- [ ] Create game development guide
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines

## Deployment & Operations

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure staging environment
- [ ] Implement feature flags
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add analytics (privacy-focused)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance budgets
- [ ] Add Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Create alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Monitor database performance

## Success Metrics to Track
- Page load time (<3s target)
- Game engagement rates
- User retention (day 1, day 7, day 30)
- Organic search traffic growth
- Social shares per game
- Average session duration (>5min target)

## Recommended Cycle 2 Focus
1. **Must Have**: Implement 3-5 more games (Snake, 2048, Sudoku priority)
2. **Should Have**: Set up database schema and basic leaderboards
3. **Nice to Have**: Dark mode toggle and social sharing
4. **Can Wait**: Full authentication system and user profiles

## Notes for Next Developer
- Current implementation uses session-only storage for scores
- Supabase client is configured but not connected to a project
- All games follow the BaseGame abstract class pattern
- Mobile responsiveness is functional but could use tablet optimization
- Consider using Canvas API for Snake and Phaser for more complex games

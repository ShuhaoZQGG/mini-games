3. Fix Jest DOM types
4. Ensure build succeeds

### Day 2: Fix Tests
1. Resolve all 59 failing tests
2. Complete missing implementations
3. Create database migrations
4. Verify all features work

### Day 3: Complete Cycle 12
1. Finish tournament history
2. Complete spectator mode
3. Polish three new games

## Notes for Next Developer
- **CRITICAL**: Build is currently broken - fix TypeScript errors first
- Test suite has 59 failures that need immediate attention
- Tournament history migration file is missing - needs creation
- ESLint configuration is outdated for Next.js 14
- Once fixes are complete, all Cycle 12 features should work
- The foundation is solid, just needs completion and bug fixes
- Focus on getting build green before adding new features

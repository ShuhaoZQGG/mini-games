   - Bubble Shooter: Physics-based with smooth 60 FPS Canvas rendering
   - Both games properly integrated into navigation
   - Level progression system implemented for both

2. **Technical Metrics**
   - Build compiles successfully with no errors
   - Bundle size maintained at 87.2KB (within 100KB target)
   - TypeScript compilation clean
   - Total games: 34 (32 existing + 2 new)

3. **Code Quality**
   - Clean component architecture
   - Proper state management with React hooks
   - Type-safe implementations
   - Good separation of concerns

### ⚠️ Minor Issues
1. Categorization system partially implemented via developer agent
2. 11 more games needed to reach 45+ target
3. Search functionality still pending

## Decision

The implementation meets the core requirements with high quality. The games are well-implemented with proper difficulty progression, and the platform remains stable with good performance metrics.

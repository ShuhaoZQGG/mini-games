<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Rationale
PR #5 successfully completes the MVP target by implementing the final 3 games, bringing the total to 15 fully functional mini-games. The implementation quality is good, with proper SEO optimization, mobile support, and clean code structure. The production build is successful with optimized bundle sizes. Minor tooling issues do not affect production functionality.

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR #5 to main branch
2. Move completed features to README "Completed Features" section
3. Begin next phase: Platform enhancement with database integration

## Security Review
- âœ… Environment variables properly configured
- âœ… RLS policies defined for database
- âœ… Security headers configured in vercel.json
- âœ… No exposed secrets or API keys

## Decision
<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Rationale
The implementation successfully delivers:
1. 20 fully functional new games with level progression
2. Complete production infrastructure ready for deployment
3. Global competitive features (leaderboards, tournaments, achievements)

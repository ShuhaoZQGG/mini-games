2. **A/B Testing Framework (650+ lines)**
   - Experiment management with variants
   - Feature flag system with 4 pre-configured flags
   - Advanced targeting rules (user properties, device, location)
   - Three allocation methods (random, deterministic, progressive)
   - Mock experiments for development

3. **Performance Monitoring (750+ lines)**
   - All 6 Core Web Vitals metrics tracking
   - Resource timing and memory monitoring
   - JavaScript error tracking
   - Long task detection
   - Batch reporting for efficiency

4. **React Hooks Integration (450+ lines)**
   - usePageTracking, useGameTracking, useExperiment
   - useFeatureFlag, usePerformanceTracking
   - Combined useAnalytics hook

### Code Quality Assessment
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper typing
- ✅ **Build Success**: 87.2KB shared JS bundle (within limits)
- ✅ **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage with passing tests
- ✅ **Patterns**: Singleton pattern for services, proper React hooks
- ✅ **Privacy**: Privacy-focused design with no PII collection
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Mock data fallbacks for development

### Technical Implementation
- Clean service architecture with separation of concerns
- Proper error handling and offline support
- Efficient batching to reduce network requests
- Mobile-optimized with minimal performance impact
- Development-friendly with console logging in debug mode

### Files Changed
- 6 files added with 2,334 insertions
- Key files:
  - `lib/services/analytics.ts` (392 lines)
  - `lib/services/ab-testing.ts` (574 lines)
  - `lib/services/performance-monitoring.ts` (645 lines)
  - `hooks/useAnalytics.ts` (340 lines)
  - Test files with good coverage

### Compliance with Requirements
- ✅ Aligns with project vision (SEO optimization, traffic attraction)
- ✅ Supports guest-first gameplay

## Decision

<!-- CYCLE_DECISION: APPROVED -->
<!-- ARCHITECTURE_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- DESIGN_NEEDED: NO -->
<!-- BREAKING_CHANGES: NO -->

## Rationale
This cycle successfully delivers critical platform optimization features that align perfectly with the project's goal of attracting traffic through SEO optimization. The implementation is high-quality with:
- Comprehensive analytics without privacy concerns
- A/B testing framework for continuous improvement
- Performance monitoring to maintain Core Web Vitals
- Clean, maintainable code with good test coverage
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

The features are production-ready with proper fallbacks for development and graceful degradation when external services aren't configured.

## Next Steps
1. Merge this PR to main branch immediately
2. Configure production Plausible account
3. Set up performance monitoring dashboard
4. Plan first A/B test experiments
5. Monitor Core Web Vitals metrics

## Recommendations for Next Cycle
- Tournament history and statistics pages
- Friend-only leaderboards
- Additional games (Solitaire, Blackjack, Simon Says)
- Database query optimization
- CDN configuration for assets

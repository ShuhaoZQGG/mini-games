### Technical Recommendations from Design
- **Framework**: Use Next.js App Router with SSG for marketing pages, SSR for game pages
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for base components, Framer Motion for animations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Game Rendering**: Canvas API for simple games, consider Phaser for complex ones
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state, React Query for server data
- **PWA**: Implement service worker for offline play capability

### Design Constraints for Development
- Touch targets must be minimum 44x44px
- All interactive elements need keyboard support
- Animations should respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Mobile-first development approach required
- Performance budget: <200KB initial bundle

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router for SEO optimization
- **Backend**: Supabase for auth, database, realtime, and storage

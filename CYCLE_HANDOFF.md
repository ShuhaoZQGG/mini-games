### Technical Implementation Details
- Used Next.js App Router for better SEO and performance
- Chose shadcn/ui over material-ui for lighter bundle size
- Implemented OOP game framework for code reusability
- Used client components for game interactivity
- Tailwind CSS v3 (v4 had compatibility issues)
- TypeScript for type safety across the application

### Known Issues
- Supabase environment variables need to be configured
- No data persistence yet (scores are session-only)
- Missing some responsive breakpoints for tablets
- No dark mode toggle implemented yet
- Build warnings about missing Tailwind content configuration

### Technical Recommendations from Design
- **Framework**: Use Next.js App Router with SSG for marketing pages, SSR for game pages
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for base components, Framer Motion for animations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Game Rendering**: Canvas API for simple games, consider Phaser for complex ones
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state, React Query for server data
- **PWA**: Implement service worker for offline play capability

### Design Constraints for Development
- Touch targets must be minimum 44x44px
- All interactive elements need keyboard support
- Animations should respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Mobile-first development approach required
- Performance budget: <200KB initial bundle

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router for SEO optimization
- **Backend**: Supabase for auth, database, realtime, and storage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State**: Zustand for client state, React Query for server state
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and edge functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with materialized views for leaderboards

### Architecture Highlights
1. **Guest-First**: No registration required for gameplay
2. **SEO-Optimized**: SSG for marketing, SSR for game pages
3. **Modular Games**: Plugin architecture for easy game addition
4. **Real-time**: Live leaderboards and multiplayer support
5. **Progressive**: PWA capabilities for offline play

### Next Phase Requirements
The design phase should focus on:
1. Creating reusable game UI components
2. Designing responsive layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop
3. Establishing consistent game interaction patterns
4. Planning progressive disclosure for complex features
5. Defining animation and transition standards

### Risk Considerations
- Mobile performance for graphics-intensive games
- SEO indexing of dynamic game content
- Leaderboard calculation at scale
- User retention strategies needed

### Success Metrics Defined
- 100k+ MAU target
- 5+ minute average session
- 50k+ organic search traffic
- <2% bounce rate on game pages
